# investing-bot
A chatbot to help me make sound investing decisions in the financial markets

## To move forward:
1. Try using an open-source LLM and check its performance
2. Finetune its responses for investing if needed
3. Allow users to send it data for it to make decisions (maybe like a CSV file)


## Goal for frontend
1. Just 1 page, with some graph + chatbot side by side
2. user ask for prediction, the prediction will run for ML and we have a stock chart of historical prices + model predictions
3. user ask about stocks/investing advice will be shown in the chatbot at the side
4. able to drag to increase space for chatbot/stock price prediction graph

## Goal for backend/ML
1. forecasting models trained and tuned
2. chatbot: for the chatbot that helps with investing, maybe can use it to perform websearch + visit the websites to get the data, before responding. (can ask it to visit only investopedia, or just add investopedia word into the search)
